# IAS0360 Final Project - Topic 2
This project tackles the concept of recognizing and
classifying heat patterns in order to detect humans. The
heat data is collected from a thermal sensor attached to
the ceiling of a room. It measures any object which emits
heat. For example, the object could be an oven, human
being or any other heat-emitting object. In order to detect
humans, a model shall be created to distinguish heat
patterns. The hypothesis of this research is that humans
can be distinguished from other heat emitting objects
using a thermal sensor. As such, the project is an object
detection task.

## Data
All the data is now in the repo. It is just a few MB.

## Labelling
Tobias: I suggest using`scripts/step1-data-understanding.ipynb`.
Please have a look and give me feedback.
Please also think about the possible classes. 
I made some suggestions but these are debateable.
In my opinion it is better, if we go into more detail.
We can derive binary classification (Human/Non-human) easily from a finer discrimination.
