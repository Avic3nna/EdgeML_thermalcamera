# IAS0360 Final Project - Topic 2
This project tackles the concept of recognizing and
classifying heat patterns in order to detect humans. The
heat data is collected from a thermal sensor attached to
the ceiling of a room. It measures any object which emits
heat. For example, the object could be an oven, human
being or any other heat-emitting object. In order to detect
humans, a model shall be created to distinguish heat
patterns. The hypothesis of this research is that humans
can be distinguished from other heat emitting objects
using a thermal sensor. As such, the project is an object
detection task.
